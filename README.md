Personal issues related to burnout and overproduction; Managed to open a bag of rotary encoders and learn about their pins.
Will hopefully Put those to use in my next test projests and definitions.

Today's contribution is another note, though a little longer;
My major focus behind this project is to make a working radio- I have parts in the post, on their way to me, most of which I'll be learning to use and apply as they arrive. This motivation came from over-playing Stalker GAMMA wherein, I found myself enjoying the simplicity of scrolling through MHz frequencies and tracking down hidden packages as a reward for my continued service to factions. I see myself -one day soon- holding a similar RF reciever of my own design, tuning in to commercial radio, or perhaps hearing something 'i shouldnt' on undescovered bands...

There's a charming secrecy to the kind of communication you can't see
I look forward to hearing it, to learning how it works on a deeper level

That said, Today's focus MUST be nutrition - I can't invent create without fuel.

PS; I've used new jumper wires (the type that sit flat against the breadboard) to properly connect pins-to-micro. I worry this inspiration won't resume once I recover... Consistency is key.
